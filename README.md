## Introduction

Drone Detection in Surveillance Videos is a project that uses a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect drones in real-time video feeds. This system is designed for security and surveillance purposes, providing accurate and efficient detection of aerial drones.

## Features
- **Real-time Drone Detection:** Utilizes the YOLOv5 model to detect drones in live video feeds.
- **High Accuracy:** Fine-tuned on a custom dataset for improved detection performance.
- **Versatile:** Can be used with webcam feeds or pre-recorded video files.
